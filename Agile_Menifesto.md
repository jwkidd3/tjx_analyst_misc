# The Agile Manifesto

**Manifesto for Agile Software Development**

## The Original Story

**In early 2001, against the backdrop of the Wasatch Mountains, in Snowbird, Utah, 17 people met to discuss the future of software development. The group’s members shared a frustration about the current state of affairs, even if they disagreed about how to remedy the situation.**

**The problem, they agreed, was that companies were so focused on excessively planning and documenting their software development cycles that they lost sight of what really mattered—pleasing their customers.**

**Companies may have touted corporate values like “excellence” and “integrity,” but these values did little to guide people—especially software developers—toward a better way. That needed to change. Many of the Snowbird 17 already had ideas about how to usher in software development’s new era. The trip to the mountains was their chance to hash it out.**

**The Agile Manifesto emerged from this extended weekend at just 68 words, and the short and sweet document went on to change software development forever. In the nearly two decades since its creation, these words (and the 12 principles that follow) have been embraced (in varying degrees) by countless individuals, teams, and companies.**

### We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools 

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items onthe right, we value the items on the left more.

### 12 **Principles behind the Agile Manifesto**

We follow these principles:

## 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

The illustration above shows how this might look. The waterfall team envisions only the final product and delivers it in silos by working on systems that will be part of the final delivery, such as the tires, the frame and finally, the car.  The agilists below them focus on the goal, which is transportation.  In their first delivery, they manage to deliver a skateboard.  In their second delivery, a skateboard with handles.  Next, they produce a bicycle, then a motorcycle, and, finally, a car.  Each delivery is usable, and each builds upon the previous work.  **These two scenarios show the difference between thinking only about the end state versus delivering value incrementally.**

But isn’t that wasteful? Surprisingly, in the real world, incremental delivery is not wasteful. In fact, it eliminates waste because stakeholders and customers provide frequent feedback about whether what the team delivered was useful or whether the team should change direction. This regular feedback loop means that teams are less likely to spend a lot of time on features that are not useful to the customer.

## 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

The Agile Manifesto’s second principle speaks to a different approach to requirements.  Traditional methods aim to reduce the amount of change while product development is in flight.  Agile does just the opposite.  Instead of focusing on reducing variation and changes to the original requirements, Agile frameworks *welcome* 
change.  Delivering value in smaller, usable increments makes this possible.  Agile teams learn something from the customer after each delivery, and because it's a smaller increment of work, it's possible to introduce new requirements.

**Why do Agile teams welcome change?**
 Teams use an agile framework in complex environments, where more is unknown than known.  In that context, does it make sense for the team to plan *everything*
 at the start, when they know less, or does it make sense to replan regularly as they learn more?

### 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

All agile frameworks rely upon the principle of delivering working software frequently, but this principle takes it a step further.  Teams must deliver *working software;* not just a cog in the machine, so to speak.

Consider the image below.  The left-hand side of the image represents the traditional way of delivering value to the customer, which is a large deliverable provided after everything envisioned in the final product is complete.  Contrast this with the right-hand side of the image, which shows an iterative (frequent), incremental (Done) approach for delivering value.  Each piece of what is delivered is usable, but it’s a smaller piece of the bigger puzzle.

In Scrum, teams determine the frequency of value delivery by the length of the Sprint.  The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver a Done, usable increment of work at least once per Sprint.  The Product Owner then determines when to release the functionality to the customer.  The Sprint length should be just long enough to allow the Developers to deliver a usable increment of product, and no longer, with a preference towards the shorter timescale.

### 4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

To me, this principle generates the most noticeable changes in the day-to-day experience of an agile team compared to a waterfall or traditional team.  Using a traditional approach, the delivery team often goes through a long, intense requirements phase where they frequently meet with the business stakeholders.  After they complete the requirements phase, the delivery team disappears to build whatever they understand the stakeholders specified.

Agile is different.  Business stakeholders meet regularly with the agile team at a lower level of engagement. In Scrum, this engagement may take place in refinement meetings or at the Sprint Review.  In other agile frameworks, this engagement may take the form of replenishment meetings.  Regardless, engagement, and therefore *visibility,* is continuous in an agile environment.

![A4D8C896-B65B-43A4-8FF5-AB940AECEBFB.jpeg](The%20Agile%20Manifesto%20a2dcab76053b4c539ee00f616c620e27/A4D8C896-B65B-43A4-8FF5-AB940AECEBFB.jpeg)

In the image above dashed lines represent a waterfall or traditional approach.  The blue lines represent Scrum, which is the most popular agile framework.  By engaging with stakeholders more frequently, agile teams provide greater visibility into product delivery.  Whereas traditional teams rely upon infrequent progress or status reports to provide visibility, Scrum teams rely upon frequent inspection of Done, usable work at the Sprint Review.

## **5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**

![EB1BCCCC-8721-4BAD-B918-7F6743F916AF.jpeg](The%20Agile%20Manifesto%20a2dcab76053b4c539ee00f616c620e27/EB1BCCCC-8721-4BAD-B918-7F6743F916AF.jpeg)

Leaders who work with agile teams focus on ensuring that the teams have the support (tools, access, resources) and environment (culture, people, external processes) they need, and then trust them to get the job done. This principle can scare some leaders who have a more command-and-control management style. They wonder how they'll know if their team is succeeding and focusing on the right things. My response to these concerns is to focus on the team’s outcomes. Are they delivering working product frequently? Are they making progress towards their goals? Those are the metrics that warrant attention. It is a necessary shift in perspective and mindset, and it is one that leaders as well as agile teams need to make to achieve the best results.

## 6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.**

With the greater adoption of Zoom and other meeting platforms, the words *face-to-face* have taken on a slightly different meaning lately, but the idea behind this principle remains.  The best way to convey information is to have a real-time conversation rather than a back-and-forth via email or messaging app.  For agile teams, this may mean that those who deliver the work speak directly to those using the work.  Or it could mean that those who deliver the work collaborate amongst themselves to solve their problems.  Each agile team determines how best to live this principle according to their unique situation.  **What matters is that collaboration is critical for all Agile teams.** 

![B6DEC86B-A642-4F8E-91A5-89C1453F4B28.jpeg](The%20Agile%20Manifesto%20a2dcab76053b4c539ee00f616c620e27/B6DEC86B-A642-4F8E-91A5-89C1453F4B28.jpeg)

## 7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**

This is the third time that the word *software* has shown up in one of the principles of the Agile Manifesto.  The use of the word  reflects the fact that agile “grew up” in software development, meaning that many of those who originally participated in the creation of the Agile Manifesto were in the software field.  Today, agile frameworks are used in venues as diverse as human resources, marketing and defense.

The seventh principle speaks to the importance of delivering working software (or product).  Success isn’t about the percentage of the work we have completed or how well we are sticking to a plan.  In agile, we measure success by the product that we have delivered, and whether it is in a usable state.   This means that progress reports, while they have their place, are not an end in themselves. Working product is ultimately what matters.

![C2C7372A-C956-4B65-8EA3-4FA45FAB5677.jpeg](The%20Agile%20Manifesto%20a2dcab76053b4c539ee00f616c620e27/C2C7372A-C956-4B65-8EA3-4FA45FAB5677.jpeg)

## 8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

Have you ever been a part of a traditional team with a critical delivery scheduled far in the future?  At first, the team approaches the work casually.  Then, as the delivery date approaches, managers ask team members to work progressively longer hours to make the deadline.  Along the way, business stakeholders inevitably change their minds about some of the requirements, which are difficult to work into the product at this late stage.  Testing start dates get squeezed, and testers have to test more and more as time begins to run out.  It’s exhausting and demoralizing.

Now, consider an agile team. The team tests the work as it  goes and  has a series of concrete steps to take. They have an unwavering focus on the end *goal.*  Because they are delivering value incrementally,  each piece is usable and is a step in the direction of the goal because they get constant stakeholder feedback about its value.  This way of approaching work means that the team establishes a steady pace. It’s a much more even paced, satisfying experience.

![1F2143AA-1E66-44D9-B7B0-2E266EE4BB19.jpeg](The%20Agile%20Manifesto%20a2dcab76053b4c539ee00f616c620e27/1F2143AA-1E66-44D9-B7B0-2E266EE4BB19.jpeg)

Climbing a flight of stairs in one leap is about as difficult as delivering one giant product release. Delivery in smaller releases is a much more sustainable approach.

## 9.**Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**

Agile teams should focus not only on feature development but also on ensuring that they deliver high-quality products. This might include addressing any existing technical debt and preventing its accumulation. Agile teams using the Scrum framework might work with the Product Owner to include items that increase product quality in the Product Backlog. Teams can also create a Definition of Done that prevents the accidental accumulation of technical debt by implementing best practices such as regular code reviews and security standards.

## **10 Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.**

Because Agile teams focus on smaller, more frequent deliveries, the attitude of the business stakeholders towards the work often changes.  Instead of asking for every requirement they may need in the future, the agile team can instead focus on the most valuable thing to do next.  This kind of focus can significantly reduce waste, as the agile teams build trust with their customers and stakeholders through frequent delivery of working software.

![0E1DC0F0-C967-4A82-9094-3F95DE65DFE5.jpeg](The%20Agile%20Manifesto%20a2dcab76053b4c539ee00f616c620e27/0E1DC0F0-C967-4A82-9094-3F95DE65DFE5.jpeg)

Focus on the next most valuable thing to do next increases business stakeholder trust through the frequent delivery of working software.

## **11 The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**

The architecture for the product, which is the underlying structure and approach to delivering the product, emerges along with feature delivery. Adhering to this principle means that the team doesn’t disappear for six months while they figure out the best long-term architecture. Instead, team members decide how best to build the product while they build the product.

## **12 At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**

I contend that adhering to this principle has the biggest impact on the happiness and efficiency of an agile team over the long term. On a regular basis, the team aks themselves, how it’s going and what changes should they should make. Then they make those changes and repeat the process regularly. A series of small improvements made over time is better than any single reorganization or process improvement project.
